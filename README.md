# OUR REPOSITORY WAS HIJACKED

## In order to fix this, we must HARD fork and re-create our entire project.

Please save your configuration files, and reinstall your pools using the official EasyNOMP repository:

### Official Repository: https://github.com/EasyX-Community/EasyNOMP

I would like to remind everyone that the Hijacked copy will have bugs, and no support.

The official copy has support, bug fixes, and continued development. It also has me, and I am irreplaceable.

EasyNOMP is now fixed, and I will resume development shortly!

#### Thank you & enjoy!

P.S. Also note that PR's will no longer be made, as it is near impossible with a completely seperate project (which I had to do to save our hijacked project)
