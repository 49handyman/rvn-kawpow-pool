# OUR REPOSITORY WAS HIJACKED

In order to fix this, we must HARD fork and create our own entire project.

Please save your configuration files, and reinstall your pools using the official EasyNOMP repository:

https://github.com/EasyX-Community/EasyNOMP

I would like to remind everyone that the Hijacked copy will have bugs, and no support.

The official copy has support, bug fixes, and continued development. It also has me, and I am irreplaceable.

Thank you!
